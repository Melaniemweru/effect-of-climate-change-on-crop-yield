# 🌾 Effect of Climate Change on Crop Yield

This project analyzes how climate change influences crop yields using real meteorological and agricultural datasets. By exploring trends such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity, we aim to uncover the impact of climate variability on agricultural productivity.

## 🔍 What This Project Does

- Cleans and explores climate and crop yield data
- Visualizes key patterns and correlations over time
- Applies time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA/MA/AR models)
- Forecasts future crop yield trends based on climate behavior

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters

Climate change introduces uncertainty in food security, especially in developing countries. Understanding its impact on crop yields is essential for:
- Designing sustainable farming strategies  
- Informing policy for agricultural planning  
- Reducing economic risk for farmers

## 🛠 How It Works

- **Language:** Python  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Jupyter Notebook  
  - Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  - statsmodels (ARIMA, MA, AR models)  
- **Notebook:** `climate_impact_analysis.ipynb`  
- **Dataset:** `climate-ds.csv`

## 📈 Sample Insights

- Year-over-year temperature increases correlated with yield drops.
- Rainfall fluctuations were strongly predictive of yield variability.
- Time series modeling shows potential for short-term yield forecasting.
